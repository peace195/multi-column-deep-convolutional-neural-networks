# multi-column-deep-convolutional-neural-networks

This project is based on two papers:

* [Multi-column Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2745.pdf)
* [Multi-organ plant identification with multi-column deep convolutional neural networks](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7844537/)

The description of the dataset is in [here](https://github.com/peace195/score-ensembles-based-SVM).

	tfRecord_writer.py: pre-process images, read and write images to TFRecord format.
	
	mcdnn_alexnet.py: concentrate to the multi-column deep flow.
